# Personal-Portfolio-FCC

This is one of my first projects from FCC, I've been working in codepen mostly.
In this project I go over basic CSS and HTML to make a personal portfolio of myself.
I practice making a nav-bar, links to different webpages to showcase my work, and also intro into appropriate view size response.
